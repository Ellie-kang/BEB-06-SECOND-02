Free Tier Usage
The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption each month. For this example, we assume that all requests and activity are spread evenly throughout the month.

On every day of a 30 day month this application would handle 41,290 requests, 1.3 compute hours, and 16.8 GB of data transfer. The app would hit the requests/compute threshold on the 24th day of the month and the data transfer threshold on the first day.

The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:

- App Services Requests: 1,000,000 requests
- App Services Compute: 7.82 hours
- Data Transfer: 10 GB
